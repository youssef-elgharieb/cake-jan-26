# Getting Started With Boilerplate

## Where is your starting boilerplate?

I have found it created for you, right [here](https://github.com/fastfishio/backend-python-training-jan-26).

## What should I do with it?
	
1. Create a branch from master call it `<your-name>-sc`. You should treat this branch as your master.
	
2. Before writing anything. Just run the boilerplate make sure you environment is working successfully.
	
3. Rename the apps you plan to use, along with all instances of their names and the corresponding libraries.
	 
	 If you are planning to use more than one app then why? Is to be able to scale each app separately?
	
4. Remove unused apps and their respective libraries.
	

# Tips

## Tests
	
- Test Driven Development TDD
	
- Use factory pattern in arrangement of test data. 
	I suggest [factory boy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
	
- Use proper testing naming convention.
