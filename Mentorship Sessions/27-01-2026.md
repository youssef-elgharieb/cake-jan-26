## Tips

### Diagrams

In my opinion, diagrams are one of the most effective ways to **present, explain, and document systems**.  They help transform complex ideas into clear, shared understanding.

Since your submission includes both a **report** and a **presentation**, investing time now in creating high-quality diagrams will pay off later. The same diagrams can be reused with minimal effort.

#### Recommended Tools
##### [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)
Markdown-inspired rendered diagrams.		
###### Motivation to use Mermaid
	
- LLMs are trained on Mermaid. So you can easily generate mermaid diagrams
	
- Easily editable since you are not dealing with UI alignment or whatnot.
	

---
###### [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/)
Your basic common drag-and-drop diagramming tool.

###### Motivation to use draw.io over Mermaid
	
- When a diagram becomes very large or highly detailed, Mermaid’s rendered output can become difficult to read or manage.

### Endpoints
	
- Only **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods are used at Noon.
	
- Never expose a **database primary key** in an endpoint but rather use a randomly generated **code** unique to the resource; because you do not want to expose an how many entries exist in the database
	

### Schemas
	
- Each table has an auto incremented foreign key named `id-<table_name>`
	
- No use of foreign keys; because handling cascades on deletions or updates is too messy.
	
- Do not hard delete, all data is useful, maintain an `is_active` attribute instead.
	
- Maintain `created_at` and `updated_at` attributes
